What you need to pay attention to is the ports of the mirror server and rcon related information in order to avoid encountering to the main server\n\nIt's not essential for a mirror server to be a MCDR server, you can use the vanilla or something else.\n\n## Config\n\nIf you want to change the config of this plugin, you can change the content of `MirrorServerReforged.json` in `config` folder\n\n```json\n{\n  \"world\":[\n    \"world\"\n  ],\n  \"command\":\"python3 -m mcdreforged\",\n  \"rcon\":{\n    \"enable\":false,\n    \"host\":\"localhost\",\n    \"port\":25565,\n    \"password\":\"password\"\n  },\n  \"source\": \"./server\",\n  \"target': './Mirror/server\"\n}\n```\n\nNow, I'll introduce the content of the config file:\n- `world` is a list include all your world's folders. For `Vanilla` type server, this can leave it as default. But for `Bukkit`/`Waterfall`/`Catserver` or other server cores like them that have more than one world folder, you need to input them in the list follow after `world`. E.G.: The `Bukkit` server has folders `world`, `world_nether`, `world_the_end`, then it should be filled with `['world','world_nether','world_the_end']`.\n- `command` Start command. Here we use this command as you use MCDR in your mirror server as default. For `Vanilla` or `Bukkit-Like` server, you need to change it to the suitable one. E.G.: `java -Xmx16G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui`\n- `rcon` will contain all the rcon-related config and this feature will only be used to turn off the mirror server remotely.\n    - `enable` is the switch of rcon feature, it should be `true` or `false`. Rcon will not be able to use if this is set to `false`, especially the command `!!msr stop`\n    - `host` is the address of your mirror server, change it as your need.\n    - `port` is the port of your mirror server, change it as your need.\n    - `password` is the password of the rcon feature on your mirror server, change it as your need.\n- `source` is the save folder of you main server save.\n- `target` is the save folder of your mirror server save.\n\n## Command List\n\n```\n!!msr help - Display help message\n!!msr sync - Sync the world to the mirror server\n!!msr reload - Reload config\n!!msr start - Start mirror server\n!!msr stop - Stop mirror server (Rcon feature enable is needed)\n!!msr init - Initalize mirror server (Use it only when you use MCDR in your mirror server)\n!!msr status - Checkout the status of your mirror server\n```\n","zh_cn":"# MirrorServerReforged\n\n![MirrorServerReforged](https://socialify.git.ci/EMUnion/MirrorServerReforged/image?description=1&font=Inter&forks=1&issues=1&language=1&owner=1&pattern=Circuit%20Board&stargazers=1&theme=Light)\n\n适用于MCDR 2.0+的镜像服插件，主要是有时间摸了，而且自己服务器确实需要这个东西，就写了XD\n\n简单说一下这个插件吧~\n\n## 初次运行\n\n本插件在初次运行的时候会进行一定的初始化，进行的操作如下（文件夹路径可以在配置文件中进行修改）\n- 在config文件夹内创建`MirrorServerReforged.json`配置文件并自动填入初始配置\n- 创建`Mirror`文件夹以用于存放镜像服文件\n- 在`Mirror`文件夹下创建`./server/world/`/`./world`（取决于你是否使用MCDR，默认为使用）\n\n但这些是仅仅不够的，你还需要做以下的操作：（路径可以在配置文件中进行修改）\n- 将你的服务器核心以及各种服务器依赖放入`./Mirror/server`内\n- 修改你的`./Mirror/`的`config.yml`中的启动命令以及rcon相关信息\n- 修改你的`./Mirror/server/server.properties`的内容，特别是要注意端口以及rcon相关内容，避免与主服务器冲突\n\n当然，镜像服务器不一定要使用MCDR，你也可以直接配置一个正常的服务器\n\n## 配置文件\n\n如果需要修改插件配置，只需要修改`config`文件夹下的`MirrorServerReforged.json`即可！\n\n```json\n{\n  \"world\":[\n    \"world\"\n  ],\n  \"command\":\"python3 -m mcdreforged\",\n  \"rcon\":{\n    \"enable\":false,\n    \"host\":\"localhost\",\n    \"port\":25565,\n    \"password\":\"password\"\n  },\n  \"source\": \"./server\",\n  \"target': './Mirror/server\"\n}\n```\n\n配置文件的内容说明如下：\n- `world`世界列表，对于`Vanilla`类型的服务器可以不用动，但是对于`Bukkit`/`Waterfall`/`Catserver`之类的客户端，它的世界文件夹有多个，则需要逐个填入，例如`world_nether`和`world_the_end`，加上原有的`world`，就应该改成`['world','world_nether','world_the_end']`\n- `command` 启动命令，对于默认的启动命令，则是在认为您使用了MCDReforged的情况下填写的，但如果是使用上面说的纯`Vanilla`或者类`Bukkit`服务端，则需要进行修改，例如改成`java -Xmx16G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui`\n- `rcon`是rcon功能的详细配置，该功能只会被用于远程关闭服务器\n    - `enable`是rcon功能的总开关，表示您是否要启用本插件的rcon来进行远程服务器的关闭，参考值为`true`和`false`，当设定为`false`时，`!!msr stop`命令将不可用\n    - `host`是rcon功能的宿服务器地址，根据自身需求填写即可\n    - `port`是rcon功能的宿服务器端口，根据自身需求填写即可\n    - `password`是rcon功能的宿服务器的密码，根据自身需求填写即可\n- `source`是你的主服务器的存档位置\n- `target`是你镜像服的存档位置\n\n## 命令列表\n\n```\n!!msr help - 显示帮助信息\n!!msr sync - 同步服务器地图至镜像\n!!msr reload - 重载配置文件\n!!msr start - 启动镜像服务器\n!!msr

Mirror Server Sync\n\nA Simple MCDR Plugin To Sync Map Files Of Minecraft On Different Servers\n\n## 一、使用前配置\n\n本插件适用于Windows系统与Linux系统\n\n在使用本插件前，你需要在你的服务器上安装Rsync\n\nLinux安装方法：`yum -y install rsync`\n\nWindows安装方法：[cwRsync - Rsync for Windows | itefix.net](https://www.itefix.net/cwrsync)下载文件后安装Exe文件，或者安装chololately后通过`choco install rsync`进行安装（需要管理员权限）\n\n一般服务器上默认会安装Rsync，为了保险，手动安装一遍。\n\n请确保您的服务器放行了所有端口以确保Rsync能正常工作\n\n打开终端，执行`ssh-keygen`。无需输入密码，无脑确认即可。再执行`ssh-copy-id Main Server IP`\n\n例如，假如我主服务器的IP为127.0.0.1，命令就为：`ssh-copy-id 127.0.0.1`\n\n之后确认Fingerprint，输入yes后输入对方服务器的密码，一路Enter。\n\n第一次启动时会自动创建mirror_server_sync.json，内容如下\n\n```json\n{\n    \"main_server_ip\": \"127.0.0.1\",\n    \"world_name\": \"world\",\n    \"main_server_dir\": \"/root/fabric_server/server\",\n    \"mirror_server_dir\": \"/root/my_mcdr_server/server\",\n    \"qb_folder_dir_main\": \"/root/fabric_server/qb_multi\",\n    \"qb_folder_dir_mirror\": \"/root/my_mcdr_server/qb_multi\",\n    \"number_of_qb_slots\": 5,\n    \"qb_auto_make\" : \"True\"\n}\n```\n\n`main_server_ip`修改为主服务器IP\n\n`mirror_server_ip`修改为镜像服IP\n\n`main_server_dir`修改为主服务器MCDR文件夹内server文件夹的绝对路径\n\n`mirror_server_dir`修改为镜像服MCDR文件夹内server文件夹的绝对路径\n\n`qb_folder_dir_main`修改为主服务器MCDR文件夹内qb_multi文件夹的绝对路径\n\n`qb_folder_dir_mirror`修改为镜像服MCDR文件夹内qb_multi文件夹的绝对路径\n\n`qb_auto_back`是是否在使用`!!msync recover`指令的时候自动确认回档信息\n\n`number_of_qb_slots`是qb备份槽数，建议主服务器镜像服保持一致\n\n修改完后就可以启动MCDR\n\n## 二、指令说明\n\n!!msync 显示用法\n\n!!msync peek 查看主服务器qb最新存档信息\n\n!!msync sync 备份当前镜像服存档，并同步主服务器qb最新存档\n\n!!msync
